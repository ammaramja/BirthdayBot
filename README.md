# BirthdayBot
Bot for wishing birthdays :)

I've used selenium webdriver in python to scrape my company's website

1) logging in with my credentials
2) finding birthdays
3) finding mail id's
4) sending them wishes through outlook e-mail
5) Close chrome

This python program is scheduled to run on my pc everyday via task scheduler.

If you have any suggestions or feedback please get back to me :)
